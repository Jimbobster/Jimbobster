- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jimbobster
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a front end web developer and possibly venturing into the cyber security area in the future.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying a coding bootcamp and enjoying the pre work I've had to do before the course officially starts.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on issues to help me along my journey, and any advice that anybody could give would be greatly appreciated :)
